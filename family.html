Right now she become the manager branch for Kedah Medical Center. I am very proud to be her daughter because she really good to manage to work and spend time with me and my brothers. Every morning she will wake up earlier around 5 a.m. to cook. She always cook for us even she tired and have a lot to do at work. At night she will spend time with us and ask us about what happen to us every day to make sure she know everything about. She really good and awesome mother. I wish one day I could be strong and as nice as her.</p>

            <p> This is my second brother. His name is Nik Muhammad Zul-Aiman Hafizi. He was 16 years old. From all of our siblings he is the most good and responsible. This because since he was young which is, 8 years old he manage to do a lot of things. For example, he can cook can washing the cloth , and many more. Right now, every morning he will wake up early, earlier than me to help my mother cooking. He will prepare the tool or raw material that my mother need to cooking. After that he will iron my mother work uniform and my brother school uniform. He is very good son. In academic he is normal type. But in our family he the good one.</p>

            <p>This is my third brother.His name is Nik Muhammad Zul-Aiman Hairie. He is 14 years old.  He is the handsome one. He a bit lazy but he have his own strength which is, he can teach his brother and his youngest brother in education field. This because, he very smart. The reason why I said he a bit lazy because when they have school online class he used to play game from night until morning and in the morning he will sleep. Because of that he rarely do household. But my mother make us a schedule. After he wake up he must wash dishes. Moreover, he still be the good son because when my mother sick he will stay up all night to take care of my mother. Right now, when school started to open, he back to normal which do not play any game anymore and focus to study because my mother will turn off the wifi  to make sure he can focus when study.</p>

            <p>This is my forth brother. He name is Nik Muhammad Zul-Aiman Hashraf. He was 12 years old this years. Because he is the youngest son he is the most pampered child. He used to sleep with my mother and really close to all of us. Something he will come to me and talk to me about anything. He is really open and very neat person. All his school uniform he will wash using his hand not by machine because he think wash using his hand is more clean and faster. He will do everthing to make sure all his stuff in neat condition. For house task he usually help with cooking the rice and make water. He is very good because he can make all the water for us every time we eat. For example, he can make the syrup ,milo water and many more .</p>
